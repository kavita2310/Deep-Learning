<h1>Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network Project</h1>

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial to improving survival rates, and machine learning techniques have shown great potential in assisting with these tasks. This project aims to develop a NEURAL NETWORK based prediction system for classifying breast cancer based on a set of features include various measurements such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and compactness, among others.

<h1>Dataset:</h1>
The dataset consists of a single table with 31 columns, including:<br>
•	Mean Radius: The average radius of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Texture: The average texture of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Perimeter: The average parameter of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Area: The average area of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Smoothness: The average smoothness of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Compactness: The average compactness of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Concavity: The average concavity of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Concave Point: The average concave point of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Symmetry: The average symmetry of the tumor.<br>
•	Mean Fractal Dimensions: The average fractal dimensions of the tumor.<br>
•	Radius Error: The error in measuring the radius of the tumor.<br>
•	Texture Error: The error in measuring the texture of the tumor.<br>
•	Perimeter Error: The error in measuring the perimeter of the tumor.<br>
•	Area Error: The error in measuring the area of the tumor.<br>
•	Smoothness Error: The error in measuring the smoothness of the tumor.<br>
•	Compactness Error: The error in measuring the compactness of the tumor.<br>
•	Concave Point Error: The error in measuring the concave point of the tumor.<br>
•	Symmetry Error: The error in measuring the symmetry of the tumor.<br>
•	Fractal Dimensions Error: The error in measuring the fractal dimensions of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Texture: The worst texture of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Radius: The worst radius of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Perimeter: The worst perimeter of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Area: The worst area of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Smoothness: The worst smoothness of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Compactness: The worst compactness of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Concavity: The worst concavity of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Concave Points: The worst concave of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Symmetry: The worst symmetry of the tumor.<br>
•	Worst Fractal Dimension: The worst fractal dimension of the tumor.<br>
•	Label: The classification label (malignant or benign).<br>

<h1>Data Collection and  Prediction System:</h1>
•	Dataset: Utilize the breast cancer dataset providing in  kaggle.<br>
•	Handling Missing Values: Check for any missing data and removal of incomplete rows.<br>
•	Standardization: Standard range to improve the performance of the neural network model.<br>
•	Splitting the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, typically with an 70-30 ration, to validate the model performance.<br>

<h1>Model Development:</h1>
•	Neural Network Architecture: Define a network architecture using layers such as:<br>
•	Input Layer: Corresponds to the number of features.<br>
•	Hidden Layers: Several fully connected layers with activation functions like ReLU.<br>
•	Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification problem.<br>
•	Loss Function: Use Binary Cross-Entropy as the loss function since this is a binary classification problem.<br>
•	Optimizer: Use optimizers like Adam or SGD for training the model efficiently.<br>
•	Activation Functions: Use ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer to provide a probability score for classification.<br>

<h1>Prediction and Interpretation:</h1>
Once training, the model can predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on new input data.

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
The goal of the project is to preprocess this data, train a deep neural network model, and create a reliable prediction system capable of classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. This system can assist healthcare professionals by providing accurate and quick prediction, supporting early diagnosis and treatment decisions.
